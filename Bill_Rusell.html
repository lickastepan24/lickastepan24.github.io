                William Felton Russell (February 12, 1934 – July 31, 2022) was an American 
                professional basketball player who played center for the Boston Celtics of t
                he National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1956 to 1969. He was the centerpiece 
                of the Celtics dynasty that won 11 NBA championships during his 13-year career.[3]
                 Russell is widely considered to be one of the greatest basketball players of all time.
At the University of San Francisco, Russell led the San Francisco Dons to consecutive NCAA 
championships in 1955 and 1956.[4] He was named NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player, and 
captained the gold medal-winning U.S. national basketball team at the 1956 Summer Olympics.[5]

After being chosen by the St. Louis Hawks with the second overall pick in the 1956 NBA draft, 
Russell was traded to the Boston Celtics for Celtics center Ed Macauley and small forward Cliff 
Hagan. With Russell as their starting center and defensive anchor, the Celtics went on to win 
their first NBA championship in 1957 and won an NBA record eight consecutive championships from 
1959 to 1966. A five-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) and a 12-time NBA All-Star, Russell's 
rebounding, defense, and leadership made him one of the dominant players of his era.[6][7][8][9] 
Standing at 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) tall, with a 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) arm span,[10][11] his shot-blocking 
and man-to-man defense were major reasons for the Celtics' dominance during his career. Russell 
also led the NBA in rebounds four times, had a dozen consecutive seasons of 1,000 or more 
rebounds,[12] and remains second all-time in both total rebounds and rebounds per game. Russell 
played in the wake of black pioneers Earl Lloyd, Chuck Cooper, and Sweetwater Clifton, and he was 
the first black player to achieve superstar status in the NBA. During the final three seasons of 
his career (1966–1969), 
he served as player-coach of the Celtics, becoming the first black NBA coach and the first
 black NBA coach to win a championship.[13] Russell ended his playing career and left his position
  as Celtics coach after helping the Celtics win the 1969 NBA championship.

Russell served as head coach and general manager of the Seattle SuperSonics from 1973 to 1977. 
He also coached the Sacramento Kings from 1987 to 1988. Russell worked as a color commentator and 
authored several books.

Russell was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975, was one of 
the founding inductees into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006 and was
 enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007. He was selected into the NBA 25th Anniversary Team
  in 1971 and the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1980, was named as one of the 50 Greatest Players
   in NBA History in 1996[5] (being one of only four players to receive all three honors), and was
    selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. In 2009, the NBA renamed the NBA Finals MVP 
    Award in his honor.[14] In 2011, Barack Obama awarded Russell the Presidential Medal of Freedom
    for his accomplishments on the court and in the civil rights movement.[15] In 2021, Russell was
    inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame a second time in recognition of his
     coaching career.[16] Shortly after his death in 2022, the NBA retired Russell's #6 jersey 
     league-wide, making him the only player in NBA history to receive that honor,[17] as well as
      the third person in North American major professional sports to have their jersey number 
      retired league-wide, behind Jackie Robinson and Wayne Gretzky.[
