                LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/ lə-BRON; born December 30, 1984) is an American
                 professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National 
                 Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed "King James", he is widely recognized 
                 as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport and is often compared 
                 to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time.[a] 
                 He has competed in 10 NBA Finals (with eight consecutive appearances from 2011 
                 to 2018), winning four NBA championships.[1] He also won the inaugural NBA Cup 
                 in 2023 with the Lakers, and two Olympic gold medals as a member of the U.S. 
                 men's national team.

                 Individually, James is the all-time leading scorer in NBA history and ranks fourth in career 
                 assists, has won four Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, four Finals MVP Awards, three All-Star 
                 Game MVP Awards, and was named the inaugural NBA Cup MVP. He has been named an All-Star a record
                 20 times, selected to the All-NBA Team 19 times (including 13 First Team selections)[2][3] and 
                 the All-Defensive Team six times, and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year
                 Award twice in his career.[4][5] Noted for his longevity, James is currently the oldest player 
                 in the NBA.[6]

                 James grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, 
                 Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around 
                 scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities.[7] A prep-to-pro, he was selected by the 
                 Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie
                 of the Year,[8] he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the 
                 Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 
                 2010.[4] After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, 
                 James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat;[9] this was announced in a nationally 
                 televised special titled The Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves in 
                 sports history.[10]

                 James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both 
                 of these years, he also earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season 
                 with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and re-signed with the Cavaliers. In 2016, 
                 he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from 
                 a 3–1 deficit, delivering the team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse.[11] 
                 In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, 
                 where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP.[12] James is the first player 
                 in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.[13] On February 7, 2023, 
                 James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the leading scorer in league history.

                 Off the court, James has earned more wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. 
                 He has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards 
                 as an executive producer), and television commercials. James was among Time's 100 most 
                 influential people in the world in 2005, 2013, 2017, and 2019, the most selections by a 
                 professional athlete. He has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred 
                 in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). James has been a part-owner of Liverpool 
                 F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary 
                 school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron.
