            <p class="popisek">
                Earvin "Magic" Johnson Jr. (born August 14, 1959) is an American businessman and former professional basketball player. 
                Often regarded as the greatest point guard of all time,
                [3][4][5][6][7] Johnson spent his entire career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). 
                After winning a national championship with Michigan State in 1979, Johnson was selected first overall in the 1979 NBA draft by the Lakers, 
                leading the team to five NBA championships during their "Showtime" era. 
                Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted HIV, but returned to play in the 1992 All-Star Game, winning the 
                All-Star MVP Award. After protests against his return from his fellow players, 
                he retired again for four years, but returned in 1996, at age 36, to play 32 games for the Lakers before retiring for the third 
                and final time.

                Known for his extraordinary court vision, passing abilities, and leadership on the court, Johnson was one of the most dominant players of his era. 
                His career achievements include three NBA Most Valuable Player Awards, 
                three NBA Finals MVPs, nine All-NBA First Team designations, and twelve All-Star games selections. He led the league in regular season assists four times, 
                and is the NBA's all-time leader in average assists per game 
                in both the regular season (11.19 assists per game) and the playoffs (12.35 assists per game).[8][9] He also holds the records for most career playoff 
                assists and most career playoff triple-doubles.[10][11] 
                Johnson was the co-captain of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team ("The Dream Team"),[12] which won the Olympic gold medal in Barcelona. 
                After leaving the NBA in 1991, he formed the Magic Johnson 
                All-Stars, a barnstorming team that traveled around the world playing exhibition games.[13]
                Johnson was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996 and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021, and became a two-time 
                inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall 
                of Fameâ€”being enshrined in 2002 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as a member of the "Dream Team".[14] His friendship and rivalry with Boston C
                eltics star Larry Bird, whom he faced in the 1979 NCAA 
                finals and three NBA championship series, are well documented.
